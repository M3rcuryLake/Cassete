# Cassette

Cassette is a Python program designed to create 30-second explanatory videos suitable for Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts. It offers multiple customization options for creating personalized videos. The program utilizes various APIs and libraries, including GPT-3.5-turbo model for transcript generation, AssemblyAI API for subtitle generation, UnrealSpeech API for voiceover generation, and ffmpeg along with moviepy for video editing.
The 'seewav' module in the given codebase is a modified version of a [pull request](https://github.com/adefossez/seewav/pull/7) by @Phoenix616 at the github page of the base seewav module

Also, you may call this a indirect **free** python interpretation of [Brainrot.js](https://www.brainrotjs.com/) (Also an inspiration)

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Install Font**: The program uses the "Permanent Marker" font located in the `./assets/` directory. Make sure to install it on your system before proceeding.
